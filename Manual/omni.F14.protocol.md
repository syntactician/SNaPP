## Perpetual Maintenance:

At the beginning of each week, please check to make sure that: 

1. There are plenty of consent forms in the organizer in the Data Cave. If there are not, print new ones.
2. There are adequate amounts of soap for hand-washing, hand and surface wipes, and electrodes. Please be proactive about this so that we have enough time to restock if necessary.
3. Check the water levels in the tanks below the sink in the kitchen, to see if the clean water tank needs to be refilled, or if the used water tank needs to be dumped. To refill, use funnel and attached tube with water fountain station down the hallway. Rolling the tank there on a chair is helpful. Used water can be disposed of in the bathroom.

You should always be aware of these things:

1. Please be exceptionally careful with the equipment in the Data Cave—it is very expensive. Prof. Settle requests that you not eat or drink in this room—keep food and beverages in the back rooms. 
2. Maintaining a constant temperature is a key element of psychophysiological research. At the first sign that the air-conditioning is not working, please fill out a maintenance request form here: http://www.wm.edu/offices/facilities/workorders/
3. Williamsburg is prone to thunderstorms. Keep an eye on the day’s weather report. If it looks like there is an exceptionally high chance of a severe storm, be prepared for the participant to cancel or to call the participant if the power goes out. (This is more of a concern when proctoring non-students.)
4. The bathrooms leave something to be desired. Make sure that the lights are on and there aren’t any dead cockroaches or other disgusting things.
5. The light in the data cave should always be kept off when there are participants in the subject room so they don’t notice the window between the two as much, especially once lights in the subject room are turned off.

## Day Before Proctoring:

1. Print 2 copies of the daily schedule for the next day for handy reference: one for the data cave, and one 	for Proctor 3 at the front desk. Change the formatting of this latter copy so that it only has the 	participant’s name, ID number, and the time they’re supposed to show up.
2. Set up the Data Cave.
	* Check to make sure that the physiological equipment is charged. It does not have to be charged each and every single day, but if in doubt, charge.
3. Set up the PowerPoint for the first participant of the next day on the secondary PC laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad).
	* To know what PowerPoint to pull up, consult the charts that list which lettered PowerPoint corresponds to which treatment group. Make sure that you are looking in the correct table for the participant’s party identification.
4. Set up the subject room.
	* Find the first participant’s preferred hand for using the mouse from the next day’s participant list, if available.
	*  Set up the small laptop desk on the side of the chair that matches the incoming participant’s desired hand for using the mouse.
	* Make sure the chair and monitor are positioned on the tape marks on the floor.
	* Check to make sure that all cords are plugged in and that room looks tidy.
		* Connect the hdmi cord from the monitor to the secondary PC in the data cave by feeding the cord through the “vacuum hole” on the wall. 
		* There is a headphone extender cord (an old style “curly cue” cord” that should connect the padded headphones to the secondary computer through the wall.
7. Make sure the debriefing and conference rooms are neat.
	* Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
	* Make sure trash is not overbearing.
	* Write “Thank you for Participating in the Omnibus Project!” or something else nice on the whiteboard.

## Day of the Study:

### Before the first participant arrives:

1. Make sure the debriefing and conference rooms are neat.
	* Set out debrief forms.
	* Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
	* Make sure trash is not overbearing.
	* Write “Thank you for Participating in the Omnibus Project!” or something else nice on the whiteboard.
2. Turn on the sink in the kitchen. To do this, open the doors underneath, and flip up the switch on the upper right-hand inner wall of the sink. The pump will make a loud noise at first, this is normal. Also check to make sure there is enough water in the tank for the day (or fill it up using water fountain down the hall and the funnel with attached tubing), and that the wastewater tank is not too full (in which case empty it in a bathroom toilet). The sink will need to be turned off at the end of each day, too.
3. Set up the physiological data collection file by following the instructions in the Biopac How-To manual up through Step 6 on pg. 6 of that guide.
4. Set up the stimulus delivery if not already done the night before.
	* Load the PowerPoint stimulus on the secondary PC laptop (Think Pad) in the data cave. Set up/turn on the external monitor in the subject room.
	* To know what PowerPoint to pull up, consult the charts that list which lettered PowerPoint corresponds to which treatment group. Make sure that you are looking in the correct table for the participant’s party identification.
	* Set the external monitor to “Extend” if not already done. (see laptop setting instructions)
	* Open the subject’s PowerPoint presentation on the secondary PC in the data cave, and move the window over to the monitor in the subject room. Make it full screen. Test to make sure it works.
	* Set up headphones and make sure they work. NOTE: If the participant wears hearing aids, you may need to connect the external speakers in a similar way. Make sure the volume is set comfortably, though it should already be at the desired volume.
5. Load Qualtrics survey on laptop in the subject room.
	* Enter treatment condition, party identification, participant name, and participant ID#.
	* Ensure closing the lid won’t lock the computer (see laptop setting instructions).
6. Check to make sure that the room looks tidy. Adjust the blinds as tightly as possible.
	* check to ensure all furniture is placed properly on the tape marks
7. Set out necessary forms in the foyer (informed consent and pens) and debriefing room.
	* Informed consent forms are located on the labeled shelf in the data cave.

### When participants first arrive in the SSRMC:

Proctor 3: Follow the instructions on the separate checklist sheet that is provided to you.
The checklist is reproduced below as follows:

1. Informed Consent Form-- have the subject sign the form, then put it in manila folder
	1. Explain that we’ll be attaching a couple of electrodes to their fingers, (kind of like a polygraph test-- except we’re not testing to see whether they’re lying), removal of which isn’t any worse than a Band-Aid. Also, they’ll be shown a few short video clips (informed consent may have wording about the video clips potentially being distressing, but if they pick up on this, tell them that we haven’t had anyone have an issue with the videos yet).
	2. You can assure them the study has been cleared by W&M’s IRB if they seem unsure.
	3. If they still don’t want to sign the form, inform them that one of the main proctors for the study will be happy to answer any other questions, and allow them to take the (as yet unsigned form) into the waiting room.
2. Chewing gum-- ask if they’re chewing any, and if so have them dispose of it in trashcan
3. Cell phone-- If they have one with them, ask them to turn it off.
	1. If it goes off in the middle of their lab session, even a vibration for a text message, it can corrupt the data we collect.
4. Hearing Aids-- ask if they’re wearing any
	1. Explain that this is because they’ll be wearing over-the-ear headphones to watch the videos, and some headphones interfere with hearing aids. We can use regular speakers if the headphones won’t be doable. They may be fine with wearing headphones even if they have hearing aids, or they may be fine with taking them out.
	2. Make a note of any issues and tell a Protocol A proctor when they come out to ask you about it.
5. Removal of jewelry
	1. Ask them to remove any jewelry in the form of watches/bracelets that go around the wrist, or rings on their finger, especially ring finger. This is for the hand that they will not be maneuvering the computer mouse with. (Most likely this will be their left hand.)
6. Wash hands
	1. Direct them to wash their hands in the sink in the kitchen. (You can explain to them that this is so that the sensors we’re placing on their hands get accurate readings.) Warn them that the sink is fairly noisy, and that how it will sound is normal.
	2. Now is the best time if they wish to have a drink of water (the water fountain is down the back hallway), or use the restroom (past the drinking fountain, through the door, and take a left-the facilities will be on the left, men’s room is first on the left, women’s is second).
7. Lead participant in waiting room-- Walk them over to and leave them in the waiting room (Rm 155), and let them know that the main proctors for the study will be with them shortly.
8. Write down what time you left them in the waiting room on the participant list for that day
	1. Also make a mental note of anything out of the ordinary, or that went wrong when trying to accomplish these items with the participant. Also, did they seem out of sorts, upset, or agitated? Did they mention it being warm in the lab, or were they out of breath?
	2. One of the other proctors will stop by to ask about these things for inclusion in their lab log.

### Participant Set Up

1. 	Before fetching the participant from the waiting room, ask Proctor 3 about hearing aids, and anything 	else that should be noted later in the lab log. If speakers need to be used instead of headphones due to 	hearing aids, switch audio cable from headphones to speakers. Try not to touch the speaker volume, as it 	should be correctly set. Run the sound check from the beginning of the PowerPoints to make sure, though, before bring subject into the room. In Data Cave, write down anything of note that Proctor 3 said for later entry into lab log.
	* If it’s the first participant of the day, they may not need to go into the waiting room. If they are 	the first participant and the speakers need to be turned on, do stash them in there while you take 	care of this and check the speaker volume.
2. Bring the participant into the subject room (once the previous participant has been taken to debriefing 	room) and have them take a seat.
	a. Show them the laptop where they will be answering surveys. Ask about the comfort with the 	mouse and make sure they can use it without excess movement.
	b. Ask them to answer the initial survey questions while leaving their non-dominant hand on the 	armrest (for practice).
	c. Instruct them to close the laptop and ring the bell when they have completed the survey 	questions.
3. Proctor 1 and Proctor 2 (unless Proctor 1 is still debriefing old participant) re-enter the room once bell is rung, hand the participant the headphones to put on themselves. The cord should be on the opposite ear from the arm with the Biopac sensor, so that the cords do not interact. (N/A if the speakers are used due to participant’s hearing aids.)
	a. Administer the physiological device on the participant’s hand according to the instructions in the 	Biopac How-To manual
		1. Electrodes go on index and middle finger (on fingerprint pads), infrared sensor on ring finger. The latter should be snug, but not cutting off circulation.
		2. Make sure that Biopac is comfortable on the participant’s wrist. It needs to snug enough that it will not move around, but not so tight that it cuts off circulation.
		3. Give the participant a brief overview of what they will be asked to do
			a. Show them the laptop where they will be answering surveys. Ask about the comfort with the mouse and make sure they can use it without moving too much
			b. Show them where the videos and instructions will be coming from (the external monitor). Let them know there will be periods of a black screen between the different parts of the study. During those parts, keep eyes on the screen, try not to move, and just relax.
			c. Tell the participant to sit back in the blue chair comfortably and to try to limit movement as much as possible. Plus, keep headphone cord away from Biopac sensor.
			d. Remind participant that there may have some questions that seem similar. Move quickly through the survey – their first answer is often their best.
		4. Remind the participant that they can stop participation at any time and to ring the bell if they have any questions.
		5. Ask the participant to focus on the screen and that the study will start shortly. 
		6. Turn off the light in the subject room.
		7. Return to the data cave, advance the slideshow once, playing the soundcheck. 	(Allow 45 seconds for the soundcheck to play.)
		8. Then, begin the AcqKnowledge recording (you must first press ‘start’, then click ‘calibrate’ at the same time you advance the slideshow). 

### Collecting Data

1. On the Mac, the Aqknowledge program should be up and ready to go from your set up before the participant arrived if working with first participant of the day. If it’s a subsequent participant, Proctor 2 resets the equipment and AcqKnowledge while Proctor 1 debriefs the previous participant.
2. Load the correct powerpoint on the Data Cave laptop.
3. press START to the begin the AcqKnowledge recording before starting the PowerPoint
4. At the same time, press Calibrate on the Mac and start the PowerPoint. IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE AT THE SAME TIME.
5. Monitor the data recording and the PowerPoint to make sure it is running properly
6. When the PowerPoint finishes the first set of videos and reaches the instruction screen, stop the recording immediately and peek at the edges of the blinds to make sure that the participant is answering the Qualtrics survey on the laptop.  When they are finished with the survey (the laptop lid pushed down and ringing the bell), advance the PowerPoint and restart the recording (SIMULTANEOUSLY) to continue
7. Repeat step 6. after the second set of videos
8. (Proctor 1) DISCUSSION STIMULUS
	* The participant thinks that they are preparing for a political conversation. You need to keep your eye on the powerpoint and give them through to the start of the final blank slide to prepare.
	* Once the switches to the black slide (25) after the topic slide (24), you should knock on the door, (enter the room and close door after you so no one overhears) and explain that there was a scheduling miscommunication and the discussant wasn’t able to join.
	* Inform them that sometimes this happens, and the survey will branch accordingly.
	* Ask the participant to close the laptop and ring the bell when they have completed the final survey questions.
9. When the PowerPoint stimulus has finished, stop the recording on the Mac and save the file with the participants five digit ID number and the date. (participantID_MM.DD.YY)
10. (Between lying and debriefing, so while the old participant is doing the last Qualtrics section.) Proctors 1 & 2: Go introduce yourselves to the next participant if they have arrived, who should be waiting in the conference room. Answer any questions about the informed consent form. If this is taking a long time, keep an ear out for the bell ringing to tell you the old participant is finished.
11. Proctor 1: When the old participant is finished with Qualtrics and has rung the bell, enter the subject room and turn the light on
	1. Remove the physiological device from the participant’s hand
		1. Throw electrodes away
		2. Offer the participant a wipe to clean the gel off their hand
		3. Turn the sensor off with the switch on the side
	2. Walk the participant to the debriefing room.
	3. Debrief the participant 
		1. Give them a debriefing form to read. Do not offer them a copy, but they can take one if they request one. Implore them not to tell anyone about the deception. 
		2. Reference the Honor Code: e.g. “Building and maintaining a community of trust is one of the stated goals of the Honor Code. We are trusting you not to reveal the deception about the “discussion” to others, especially those who may take part in the Omnibus Project after you, as this is crucial to the eventual success of this study.”
		3. Ask them if they would like a copy of the informed consent to take home (blank copies are in the manila folder on the front desk, or in the data cave).
		4.  Let subjects know that at this point in time they can ask any questions about the experiment that they have just completed.
		5. If there are questions, just try and answer them to the best of your ability but remain as vague as possible. For people who are really pushing to have questions answered that you don’t feel comfortable with, refer them to the contact information at the bottom of the debriefing form.
		6. Thank them for their time and for participating in the Omnibus Project.
		7. Make sure the coast is clear and the new participant is already in single subject room before releasing old participant from the debrief room.


### Proctor 2’s Between-Participants Tasks

1. While old participant is being debriefed by Proctor 1:
	a. Pull up PowerPoint for next participant.
	b. Open new Acknowledge Graph (having already saved the old one with XXXXX_MM.DD.YY format using 5-digit unique subject ID).
	c. Wipe down headphones, mouse, keyboard, and bell.
	d. Attach new electrodes to the Biopac Sensor
	e. Pull up the Qualtrics lab survey on the participant laptop, enter in the beginning information off of the daily participant list.
	f. Switch the side the computer is one if needed for change in handedness.
	g. Ask Proctor 3 about hearing aids/speakers vs. headphones. Also ask about anything that should be included in the lab log, and write it down.
2. If pressed for time, while Proctor 1 is still debriefing: bring new participant into subject room, have them start on first section of lab survey.
3. At this point, Proctor 1 should be done debriefing the old participant. Proctors 1&2 then cycle back to Step (d.) of p. 4 when the participant rings the bell after completing the first lab survey section.

### Lab Log:

1. Once the new participant has been started on the first set of videos, fill out the Lab Log for the old participant. (If it’s the last participant of the day, fill it out as soon as they leave.) Both proctors should be there to fill out the lab log. It is important you do this as soon as possible after the subject leaves so that you don’t forget any pertinent detail. No detail is too small to note.
2. Make sure to include any information from Proctor 3 that you wrote down before
	* Proctor 2: Wipe down headphones, keyboard, and mouse. 
	* Proctor 2: If there is more than one subject being run that day, you will need to [potentially] be prepared to reset the participant-specific set-up very quickly: positioning the computer table and mouse on the participant’s dominant side, loading up the new PowerPoint with the discussion partner’s name, loading a fresh Qualtrics survey, etc. 

### At the End of the Day:

1. Copy the day’s AcqKnowledge data into the backup folder on the external hard drive
2. Download the Qualtrics survey and save it in the format “ MM_DD_YYYY” on the external hard drive
3. At the end of each week, make a copy of the whole week’s data (both physiological and survey) and store it on the shared drive.
4. Shut everything down.
5. Make sure the BioPac is turned off and plugged in to charge.
6. Turn off sink, refill freshwater tank if needed, and empty wastewater tank if needed.
7. Make any remaining notes in the participant log.
8. Re-check inventory. Electrodes, informed consent forms, wipes, and soap. 
	* When getting remotely low on anything, notify Professor Settle ASAP so that it can be restocked in time.
9. Wipe down headphones, laptop, and other surfaces.

###Questions to Anticipate:

1. What is the purpose of this study? OR Why do you want this data?
	* The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiological responses to viewing contentious video clips.
2. Why was my discussion partner not there? What was the purpose?
	* This person was never going to be here. The purpose was to see the physiological response to anticipating a political discussion.
3. Who else is participating in this study?
	* For confidentiality purposes, we can’t tell you who else is participating or has participated in this study.
4. “What are you going to do with this information?”
	* The information will be published in scholarly papers once all of the data has been properly analyzed.
5. “Can I see my scores?”
	* Right now, none of the data has been analyzed and since your scores are tied to a subject number, there is no way for me to tell you exactly how you did.
6. “Can I get a copy of my results?”
	* Due to confidentiality concerns, we are unable to produce individual reports.
