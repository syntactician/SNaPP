Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study! The general purpose of this research was to better understand the way individuals respond to political contention.  In this study, you were asked to watch some contentious videos and prepare for a political discussion.  The potential political discussion was part of the study that was intentionally not going to occur because we were interested in the physiological response to anticipating political discussion.  All participants had both political and non-political content as the focus of their session. The results of this study will be used to advance knowledge on the influence of contention on political behavior.  More information about the results of the study will be available to you at the conclusion of the study.
