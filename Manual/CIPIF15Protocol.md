# Fall 2015 CIPI Omnibus Protocol

## Perpetual Maintenance:

#### At the beginning of each week, check to ensure that:

1. There are plenty of consent forms in the organizer in the Data Cave. If there are not, print new ones.
2. There are both hand and surface wipes, and both EDA and ECG electrodes. Be proactive so we have ample warning to restock.
3. Check the water levels in tanks of the kitchen sink. To refill the tank, use the funnel at the water fountain. When the used water is near full, dispose of it in the bathroom.

#### Always be aware:

1. Be exceptionally careful with the equipment in the Data Cave -- it is very expensive. Do not eat or drink in this room.
2. Temperature control is key to psychophysiological research. At the first sign of trouble, fill out a maintenance request here: [http://www.wm.edu/offices/facilities/workorders](http://www.wm.edu/offices/facilities/workorders)
3. Williamsburg is prone to thunderstorms, so keep an eye on the weather report. If there's a high chance of a storm, be prepared for the participant to cancel or to notify the participant if the power goes out (this is especially a concern when proctoring non-students}.
4. The bathrooms leave something to be desired. Make sure that the lights are on and there aren't any dead cockroaches or other disgusting things.
5. The light in the data cave should always be kept off when there are participants in the subject room so they don't notice the window between the two as much, especially once lights in the subject room are turned off.

## Day Before Proctoring:

1. Print two copies of the daily schedule for the next day: one for the Data Cave, and one for the proctoring clipboard. The latter should only have the participant's name, ID number, and scheduled time.
2. Set up the Data Cave:
    * Check to make sure that the BioNomadix units are charging. If they are not, plug them in.
3. Set up the subject room:
    a. Check the next day's list for the first participant's handedness. Set up the laptop desk accordingly.
    b. Check that the chair and monitor are positioned on the tape marks on the floor.
    c. Check that all the cords are connected:
        * VGA cord from SuperLab iMac to external monitor, through the wall
        * Headphone extension cord to the SuperLab iMac, through the wall
    d. Ensure the room looks tidy.
4. Set up the debriefing room:
    a. Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
    b. Check trash cans for excessive trash.
5. Check the water tank levels in the kitchen sink:
    a. If the used water tank is full, empty it in the bathroom.
    b. If the clean water tank is empty, use a rolling chair to move the tank to the water bottle refill station down the hallway, and use the funnel and attached tube to refill.

## Day of the Study:

#### Before the first participant arrives:

1. Make sure the debriefing room is neat.
    a. Set out a debriefing form.
    b. Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
    c. Check trash cans for excessive trash.
    d. Write “Thank you for participating in the Omnibus Project!” or something similar on the whiteboard.
2. Check the water tank levels in the kitchen sink.
    1. If the used water tank is full, empty it in the bathroom.
    2. If the clean water tank is empty, use a rolling chair to move the tank to the water bottle refill station down the hallway, and use the funnel and attached tube to refill.
3. Turn on the sink. To do this, open the doors underneath, and flip up the switch on the upper right-hand inner wall of the sink. The pump will make a loud noise at first, this is normal.
    * Additionally, the sink will need to be turned off at the end of each day.
4. Set up the Acq*Knowledge* file by following the instructions in the BIOPAC How-To manual up through ~~Step 6 on pg. 6 of that guide~~.
5. Load the stimulus presentation in SuperLab.
    1. When prompted, enter participant's party ID by pressing the “d” key for Democrat, “r” for Republican, ~~or “i” for true Independents~~. Use lowercase letters.
    2. On the next screen, enter their treatment condition (by pressing the number key corresponding to their condition number).
6. Load the Qualtrics lab survey on the laptop in the subject room.
    1. Enter the treatment condition, party identification, participant name, and participant ID#.
    2. Check data cave copy of daily schedule for participant's preferred handedness and hearing aid use.
        * Set up the small laptop desk on the side of the chair to match handedness.
        * If participant is unable to wear headphones due to hearing aids, turn on speakers and run a sound check
7. Check to make sure that the room is set up:
    a. Adjust the blinds as as needed in Data Cave.
    b. Check to ensure all furniture is placed properly on the tape marks
8. Set out necessary forms in the foyer (informed consent and pens) and debriefing room.
    * All forms are located on their labeled shelves in the data cave.

#### When participants  first arrive in the SSRMC:

1. Follow the items on the seperate checklist that is provided.
2. That checklist is reproduced and elaborated here:
    1. **Arrival time if waiting** -- If you are unable to immediately begin proctoring, write down the participant's time of arrival on the daily participant list. Do not proceed with the rest of the checklist until you are ready to proctor the full lab session for the participant.
    2. **Informed consent form** -- Have the subject sign the form, and put it in the manila folder. While they do, give them an overview:
        a. **hooking up to equipment** -- Explain that we’ll be attaching a couple of electrodes to their fingers, the removal of which isn’t any worse than a Band-Aid.
        b. **watch videos** -- Explain they'll be shown a few short video clips (informed consent may have wording about the video clips being potentially distressing, but if they pick up on this, ensure them that we haven’t had anyone have an issue with the videos yet).
        c. **answer survey questions** -- Explain that they'll be answering some survey questions.
    3. **Chewing gum** -- Ask if they're chewing gum, and if so, have them dispose of it.
    4. **Cell phone** -- If they have one with them, ask them to turn it off. Inform them that having it go off, even on vibrate, can damage out data.
    5. **Jewelry/watch removal** -- Ask the to remove all jewerly on their wrists and hands.
    6. **Rinse hands** -- Direct them to rinste their hands in the kitchen sink. Warn them that the sink is noisy.
    7. **Mental notes for lab log** -- If there are any abnormalities, or the participant seems agitated, or out of breath, or nots that it is hot, or anything of this nature, make a mental note and record it in the lab log once the session begins.

#### Starting the Lab Session:

1. Once you've completed the check-in checklist, direct the participant to sit in the chair in the subject room.
2. Once they are seated, show them the laptop on which they'll be answering surveys.
    a. Explain they will need to keep the sensor hand still once study begins. Ensure that they can use the mouse comfortably and without excess movement of their other arm.
    b. Ask them to answer the initial survey questions while leaving their non-dominant hand on the armrest (for practice).
    c. Instruct them to close the laptop and ring the bell when they have completed the survey 	questions.
3. Leave room while participant completes first questions.
4. After the bell is rung, turn off the lights in the datacave, and re-enter the subject room.
5. Hand the subject headphones

#### Collecting Data:

# FINISH ME

#### Between Participants:

1. Make sure previous Acq*Knowledge* recording was saved with XXXXX(problem).acq and XXXXX(problem).txt formats using their 5-digit unique subject ID).
2. Wipe down headphones, mouse, keyboard, and bell.
3. Make sure fresh electrodes are laid out, haven’t dried out.
4. Pull up new lab survey on participant laptop.
5. Check if laptop cart needs to be switched for handedness of next participant.
6. Check if speakers need to be used instead of headphones. Run sound check if so.
7. Pull up SuperLab for next participant.
8. Open new Acq*Knowledge* Graph (having already saved the old one with XXXXX(problem).acq and XXXXX(problem).txt formats using their 5-digit unique subject ID).
9. Fill out and submit lab log for old participant.
10. Open new lab log, fill out the initial parts for next participant.


#### Lab Log:

After resetting the participant room and debriefing the old participant, complete the Lab Log for the old participant. (For the last participant of the day, fill it out as soon as they leave.)
     * If there are multiple proctors, all of them should confer to ensure everything makes it to the lab log. 
     * It is important you do this as soon as possible after the subject leaves so that you don’t forget any pertinent detail. No detail is too small to note.


#### At the End of the Day:

1. Turn off and charge BioNomadix sensor
2. Backup:
    a. The day’s Acq*Knowledge* data into the backup folder on the external hard drive
    b. Qualtrics surveys (both lab logs and lab surveys) and save it in the format “MM_DD_YYYY” on the external hard drive.
3. At the end of each week, make a copy of the whole week’s data (both physiological and surveys) and store it on the shared drive.
4. Shut everything down.
5. Turn off sink
    * Refill freshwater tank if needed; empty wastewater tank if needed.
6. Re-check inventory. Electrodes, informed consent forms, and wipes.
    * When getting remotely low on anything, notify Professor Settle ASAP so that it can be restocked in time.
7. Wipe down headphones, laptop, mouse, bell, and other surfaces.


## Questions to Anticipate:

* What is the purpose of this study? OR Why do you want this data?
    * The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiological responses to viewing contentious video clips.
* Why was my discussion partner not there? What was the purpose?
    * This person was never going to be here. The purpose was to see the physiological response to anticipating a political discussion.
* Who else is participating in this study?
    * For confidentiality purposes, we can’t tell you who else is participating or has participated in this study.
* What are you going to do with this information?
    * The information will be published in scholarly papers once all of the data has been properly analyzed.
* Can I see my scores?
    * Right now, none of the data has been analyzed and since your scores are tied to a subject number, there is no way for me to tell you exactly how you did.
* Can I get a copy of my results?
    * Due to confidentiality concerns, we are unable to produce individual reports.
