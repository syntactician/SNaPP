#### Deception Script
So... it turns out that your discussion partner never showed up.

Normally, the discussion is the last part of the lab session, but we did this study last year, and unfortunately we had enough no-shows that we knew we needed a backup plan going forward.

So instead of having the discussion, the last part of your lab session will be this extra portion of the survey I'm going to pull up on the laptop.
