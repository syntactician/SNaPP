The general nature of this study entitled "Psychophysiology and Attitudes in an Adult Population" conducted by Dr. Jaime Settle has been explained to me. I understand that I may be asked to watch videos, discuss politics, and read political discussion. I understand that I will be fitted with a comfortable, non-invasive sensor fitted to my wrist like a watch that will measure the electrical activity of my skin.
