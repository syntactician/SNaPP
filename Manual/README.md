#### Lab Manual Materials

The creation of SNaPP Lab teaching materials is ongoing. The files in this directory will largely be  Markdown files of currently ongoing projects. Pictures referenced in the documents are all contained in the .Pictures directory. They will not work correctly if they are moved or if the .Pictures directory is separated from them or renamed.
If you need these documents in a different format (.pdf, .docx, etc.), check the Export directory. Keep in mind that since these are static documents created from the "*living*" markdown, they may be out of date. To ensure you're up to date, or if what you need isn't here in the format you need, you'll need to convert it yourself. The markdown conventions in all of these documents are compatible with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html), so I suggest starting there.
