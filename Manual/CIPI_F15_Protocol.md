# Fall 2015 CIPI Omnibus Protocol

## Perpetual Maintenance:

#### At the beginning of each week, check to ensure that:

1. There are plenty of consent forms in the organizer in the Data Cave. If there are not, print new ones.
2. There are both hand and surface wipes, and both EDA and ECG electrodes. Be proactive so we have ample warning to restock.
3. Check the water levels in tanks of the kitchen sink. To refill the tank, use the funnel at the water fountain. When the used water is near full, dispose of it in the bathroom.

#### Always be aware:

1. Be exceptionally careful with the equipment in the Data Cave – it is very expensive. Do not eat or drink in this room.
2. Temperature control is key to psychophysiological research. At the first sign of trouble, fill out a maintenance request here: [http://www.wm.edu/offices/facilities/workorders](http://www.wm.edu/offices/facilities/workorders)
3. Williamsburg is prone to thunderstorms, so keep an eye on the weather report. If there's a high chance of a storm, be prepared for the participant to cancel or to notify the participant if the power goes out (this is especially a concern when proctoring non-students}.
4. The bathrooms leave something to be desired. Make sure that the lights are on and there aren't any dead cockroaches or other disgusting things.
5. The light in the data cave should always be kept off when there are participants in the subject room so they don't notice the window between the two as much, especially once lights in the subject room are turned off.

## Day Before Proctoring:

1. Print two copies of the daily schedule for the next day: one for the Data Cave, and one for the proctoring clipboard. The latter should only have the participant's name, ID number, and scheduled time.
2. Set up the Data Cave:
    * Check to make sure that the BioNomadix units are charging. If they are not, plug them in.
3. Set up the subject room:
    a. Check the next day's list for the first participant's handedness. Set up the laptop desk accordingly.
    b. Check that the chair and monitor are positioned on the tape marks on the floor.
    c. Check that all the cords are connected:
        * VGA cord from SuperLab iMac to external monitor, through the wall
        * Headphone extension cord to the SuperLab iMac, through the wall
    d. Ensure the room looks tidy.
4. Set up the debriefing room:
    a. Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
    b. Check trash cans for excessive trash.
5. Check the water tank levels in the kitchen sink:
    a. If the used water tank is full, empty it in the bathroom.
    b. If the clean water tank is empty, use a rolling chair to move the tank to the water bottle refill station down the hallway, and use the funnel and attached tube to refill.

## Day of the Study:

#### Before the first participant arrives:

1. Make sure the debriefing room is neat.
    a. Set out a debriefing form.
    b. Arrange chairs so it looks nice and organized.
    c. Check trash cans for excessive trash.
    d. Write “Thank you for participating in the Omnibus Project!” or something similar on the whiteboard.
2. Check the water tank levels in the kitchen sink.
    1. If the used water tank is full, empty it in the bathroom.
    2. If the clean water tank is empty, use a rolling chair to move the tank to the water bottle refill station down the hallway, and use the funnel and attached tube to refill.
3. Turn on the sink. To do this, open the doors underneath, and flip up the switch on the upper right-hand inner wall of the sink. The pump will make a loud noise at first, this is normal.
    * Additionally, the sink will need to be turned off at the end of each day.
4. Open the Acq*Knowledge* graph template file.
5. Load the stimulus presentation in SuperLab.
    1. When prompted, enter participant's party ID by pressing the “d” key for Democrat, “r” for Republican, ~~or “i” for true Independents~~. Use lowercase letters.
    2. On the next screen, enter their treatment condition (by pressing the number key corresponding to their condition number).
6. Load the Qualtrics lab survey on the laptop in the subject room.
    1. Enter the treatment condition, party identification, participant name, and participant ID#.
    2. Check data cave copy of daily schedule for participant's preferred handedness and hearing aid use.
        * Set up the small laptop desk on the side of the chair to match handedness.
        * If participant is unable to wear headphones due to hearing aids, turn on speakers and run a sound check
7. Check to make sure that the room is set up:
    a. Adjust the blinds as needed in Data Cave.
    b. Check to ensure all furniture is placed properly on the tape marks
8. Set out necessary forms in the foyer (informed consent and pens) and debriefing room.
    * All forms are located on their labeled shelves in the data cave.

#### When participants  first arrive in the SSRMC:

Follow the items on the separate checklist that is provided.  
That checklist is reproduced and elaborated here:

1. **Arrival time if waiting** – If you are unable to immediately begin proctoring, write down the participant's time of arrival on the daily participant list. Do not proceed with the rest of the checklist until you are ready to proctor the full lab session for the participant.
2. **Informed consent form** – Have the subject sign the form, and put it in the manila folder. While they do, give them an overview:
    a. **hooking up to equipment** – Explain that we’ll be attaching a couple of electrodes to their fingers, wrist, and ankles, the removal of which isn’t any worse than a Band-Aid.
    b. **watch videos** – Explain they'll be shown a few short video clips (informed consent may have wording about the video clips being potentially distressing, but if they pick up on this, ensure them that we haven’t had anyone have an issue with the videos yet).
    c. **answer survey questions** – Explain that they'll be answering some survey questions.
3. **Chewing gum** – Ask if they're chewing gum, and if so, have them dispose of it.
4. **Cell phone** – If they have one with them, ask them to turn it off. Inform them that having it go off, even on vibrate, can damage out data.
5. **Jewelry/watch removal** – Ask them to remove all jewelry on their wrists and hands.
6. **Rinse hands** – Direct them to rinste their hands in the kitchen sink. Warn them that the sink is noisy.
7. **Mental notes for lab log** – If there are any abnormalities, or the participant seems agitated, or out of breath, or you notice that it is hot, or anything of this nature, make a mental note and record it in the lab log once the session begins.

#### Starting the Lab Session:

1. Once you've completed the check-in checklist, direct the participant to sit in the chair in the subject room.
2. Once they are seated, show them the laptop on which they'll be answering surveys.
    a. Explain they will need to keep the sensor hand still once study begins, when not using the laptop. Ensure that they can use the mouse comfortably and without excess movement of their other arm.
    b. Ask them to answer the initial survey questions while leaving their non-dominant hand on the armrest (for practice).
    c. Instruct them to close the laptop and ring the bell when they have completed the survey 	questions.
3. Leave room while participant completes first questions.
4. While out of the room, add the PPGED-R module according to the instructions in the BIOPAC Manual and complete the initial calibrations.
4. After the bell is rung, turn off the lights in the datacave, and re-enter the subject room.
5. Administer the sensors to the participant according to the instructions provided in the BIOPAC Manual.
    a. Attach the BioNomadix unit to the wrist **opposite** the participant's dominant hand.
    b. EL507 electrodes are to connect the BioNomadix unit's leads to the tips of the index and middle fingers.
        * Black – index
        * Red – middle
    c. Cloth EL504 electrodes are to connect the ECG leads to the ankles and the right forearm.
        * White – right arm
        * Red – left ankle
        * Black – right ankle
6. Give the participant a brief overview of what they will be asked to do:
    a. Inform them that videos and instructions will be presented on the monitor.
    b. Make sure they understand that there will be blank screens in between these presentations.
    c. Instruct them to sit back, relax, and limit their motion as much as possible *including while nothing is on screen*.
    d. Instruct them to ring the bell if they have questions.
7. Remind the participant that they can stop their participation at any time.
8. Turn off the light and leave the room.

#### Collecting Data:

Acq*Knowledge* should already be up and ready to collect data. If it is not, you must disconnect the BioNomadix unit from the participant and set it up now before you proceed.

1. Bring up the lab log side-by-side with the Acq*Knowledge* graph.
2. Press START to begin the Acq*Knowledge* recording before starting SuperLab.
3. Monitor the data recording in Acq*Knowledge* for 30 seconds to make sure it is collecting properly (when in doubt, refer to the BIOPAC Manual.
4. After the first set of videos ends and the instruction screen appears, peek through the blinds to make sure that the participant is answering the Qualtrics survey on the laptop. When they are finished (the laptop lid is pushed down and the bell is rung), advance the stimulus by pressing the spacebar on the SuperLab iMac.
5. Repeat step 4 after the second set of videos
6. **DISCUSSION STIMULUS**
    a. The participant thinks that they are preparing for a political conversation. Give them until the end of the stimulus.
    b. After the stimulus, knock on the door, enter the room, close the door after you, and perform the deception according to the following script:
        * So... it turns out that your discussion partner never showed up.
        * Normally, the discussion is the last part of the lab session, but we did this study last year, and unfortunately we had enough no-shows that we knew we needed a backup plan going forward.
        * So instead of having the discussion, the last part of your lab session will be this extra portion of the survey I’m going to pull up on the laptop.
    c. Open the laptop and click through the question that comes up asking whether the discussion partner showed up.
    d. Leave the room for them to complete the survey.
8. Between lying and debriefing, while the participant is doing the last Qualtrics section:
    a. Save the Acq*Knowledge* graph as both `XXXXX(problem).acq` and `XXXXX(problem).txt`
        * `XXXXX` should be replaced by the participant’s ID number.
        * `(problem)` should be replaced with text describing the nature of any glaring problems about the data or the session only if there in one. A non-problematic session should look like `XXXXX.acq`, whereas one in which the PPG failed might look like `XXXXXbadppg.acq`.
        * The file should be saved as both a .acq and .txt file (these are options in the save dialogue box).
    b. If there is time, prepare a new graph for the next participant.
10. When the old participant is finished with Qualtrics and has rung the bell, enter the subject room and turn the light on.
11. Verify that the lab survey has been submitted.
12. Remove the sensors from the participant.
    * Throw electrodes away
    * Offer the participant a wipe for the electrode sites.
    * Turn the sensor off with the switch on the side
13. Walk the participant to the debriefing room, close the door, and debrief them.
    * Give them a debriefing form to read.
    * Do not offer them a copy, but they can take one if they request one.
    * Implore them not to tell anyone about the deception.
    * Reference the Honor Code: e.g. "Building and maintaining a community of trust is one of the stated goals of the Honor Code. We are trusting you not to reveal the deception about the “discussion” to others, especially those who may take part in the Omnibus Project after you, as this is crucial to the eventual success of this study."
    * Ask them if they would like a copy of the informed consent to take home (blank copies are in the manila folder on the front desk, or in the data cave).
    * Let subjects know that at this point in time they can ask any questions about the experiment that they have just completed.
    * If there are questions, just try and answer them to the best of your ability but remain as vague as possible. For people who are really pushing to have questions answered that you don’t feel comfortable with, refer them to the contact information at the bottom of the debriefing form.
    * Thank them for their time and for participating in the Omnibus Project.
14. Check whether the next participant has already arrived before leaving debriefing room, to ensure nothing gets said after you leave the debriefing room.

#### Between Participants:

1. Make sure previous Acq*Knowledge* recording was saved with `XXXXX(problem).acq` and `XXXXX(problem).txt` formats using their 5-digit unique subject ID).
j2. Wipe down headphones, mouse, keyboard, and bell.
3. Make sure fresh electrodes are laid out, haven’t dried out.
4. Pull up new lab survey on participant laptop.
5. Check if laptop cart needs to be switched for handedness of next participant.
6. Check if speakers need to be used instead of headphones. Run sound check if so.
7. Pull up SuperLab for next participant.
8. Open new Acq*Knowledge* Graph (having already saved the old one with XXXXX(problem).acq and XXXXX(problem).txt formats using their 5-digit unique subject ID).
9. Fill out and submit lab log for old participant.
10. Open new lab log, fill out the initial parts for next participant.


#### Lab Log:

After resetting the participant room and debriefing the old participant, complete the Lab Log for the old participant. (For the last participant of the day, fill it out as soon as they leave.)
     * If there are multiple proctors, all of them should confer to ensure everything makes it to the lab log. 
     * It is important you do this as soon as possible after the subject leaves so that you don’t forget any pertinent detail. No detail is too small to note.


#### At the End of the Day:

1. Turn off and charge BioNomadix sensor
2. Backup:
    a. The day’s Acq*Knowledge* data into the backup folder on the external hard drive
    b. Qualtrics surveys (both lab logs and lab surveys) and save it in the format “MM_DD_YYYY” on the external hard drive.
3. At the end of each week, make a copy of the whole week’s data (both physiological and surveys) and store it on the shared drive.
4. Shut everything down.
5. Turn off sink
    * Refill freshwater tank if needed; empty wastewater tank if needed.
6. Re-check inventory. Electrodes, informed consent forms, and wipes.
    * When getting remotely low on anything, notify Professor Settle ASAP so that it can be restocked in time.
7. Wipe down headphones, laptop, mouse, bell, and other surfaces.


## Questions to Anticipate:

* What is the purpose of this study? OR Why do you want this data?
    * The purpose of this study is to investigate the physiological responses to viewing contentious video clips.
* Why was my discussion partner not there? What was the purpose?
    * This person was never going to be here. The purpose was to see the physiological response to anticipating a political discussion.
* Who else is participating in this study?
    * For confidentiality purposes, we can’t tell you who else is participating or has participated in this study.
* What are you going to do with this information?
    * The information will be published in scholarly papers once all of the data has been properly analyzed.
* Can I see my scores?
    * Right now, none of the data has been analyzed and since your scores are tied to a subject number, there is no way for me to tell you exactly how you did.
* Can I get a copy of my results?
    * Due to confidentiality concerns, we are unable to produce individual reports.
